# Web App Issues
Official issue tracker for [Typst's web app.][app] Here, you can report bugs or
send feature requests for the official web app. If you want to report a bug with
the Typst language or compiler instead, please [open an issue here][compiler].

## FAQ
- **Will the web app remain free?** \
  The web app will always have a free tier. However, we will also add paid plans
  in the future.

- **Is the web app open source?** \
  The web app is not open source. We think open-sourcing the compiler and
  keeping the app proprietary is a fair division that allows the project to
  sustain itself long-term.

- **Can I self-host the web app?** \
  Yes! We offer a paid on-premises version for organizations. If this is
  interesting for you or your team, please reach out to us at <hello@typst.app>.

- **Will there be a desktop app?** \
  We plan to provide a desktop version of the web app down the road, but can't
  give a timeframe for this at the moment.

- **Where do you store my data / is my data safe?** \
  Your data is stored in a Microsoft Azure data center in Germany and encrypted
  at rest. We can access your documents, but do so only to fix problems on your
  request or to enforce our terms of service. Read our [privacy policy] for more
  details.
